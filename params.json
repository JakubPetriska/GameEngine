  "body": "Simple game engine for Android written in Java.\r\nEngine currently supports Android 2.3 (API level 9) and up.\r\n\r\n![](https://jakubpetriska.github.io/GameEngine/images/showcase.png)\r\n\r\n![](https://jakubpetriska.github.io/GameEngine/images/sample.png)\r\n\r\nCreated as a bachelor's thesis at CTU in Prague.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nComplete javadoc for engine's API can be seen [here](https://jakubpetriska.github.io/GameEngine/javadoc-0.4.1/index.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Coordinate system\r\nLeft-handed coordinate system with _z_ axis pointing forward, _y_ pointing up and _x_ to the right.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tutorial\r\nIn this tutorial you will create a simple application showing only the engine content. Engine will display an object that player will be able to move using his finger.\r\n\r\nFor more examples and samples of working projects using the engine check out the _sample_ and _showcase_ project modules. These contain the sample and showcase applications respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project setup\r\nCreate new Android Studio project and either add the whole _engine_ and _android-adapter_ modules into your project, upon which module with your application will be dependent or build the engine's aar file and add it to your project.\r\n\r\nNow you must add the engine activity to the AndroidManifest.xml. In this tutorial you will add the activity as main application activity, however it does not have to be the main activity.\r\n\r\nTo add this activity, place the following code into <application> tag of your AndroidManifest.xml.\r\n\r\n    <activity android:name=\"com.jakubpetriska.gameengine.api.android.GameEngineActivity\">\r\n        <intent-filter>\r\n            <action android:name=\"android.intent.action.MAIN\" />\r\n            <category android:name=\"android.intent.category.LAUNCHER\" />\r\n        </intent-filter>\r\n    </activity>\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n    Copyright 2016 Jakub Petriska\r\n\r\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n    limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n",
